He doesn't qualify at all. He ran a company, arrogantly and sometimes cruelly, that made some nice computers and other gadgets.
If you're looking for great human beings, try Jonas Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine and then gave it away rather than patenting it and making a fortune. Or Gandhi, who freed a nation by nonviolent resistance, and paid for his tolerance with his life. Or Florence Nightingale, who fought tirelessly for better hygiene and better nursing in hospitals. Or Harriet Tubman, who made 13 trips into the Deep South at the risk of her life to bring slaves to freedom along the Underground Railroad. Or Jacques Cousteau, who made us realize that the health of the planet depends upon the health of the oceans. 
You need to raise your standards a bit.
