My girlfriend and I went to watch Avatar when it was released. Apparently, it was her first 3D movie experience and God was she excited.

When she came out of the theater, visibly overwhelmed, she asked me, "Don't you think the world would be much more beautiful if we could see it in 3D?"

I drank myself to death that night.

EDIT: This is now the most upvoted answer on Quora. Thank you guys, my girlfriend will be so proud.
